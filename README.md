# UETools-GUI
Dumper-7 (SDK) based solution for rapid debugging of Unreal Engine powered titles. Designed for a minimal setup experience: you can have it running within 5 minutes from the initial download.

> [!NOTE]
> Title is considered supported only if Dumper-7 successfully generates a valid SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> Solution is targeting Unreal Engine 4.27.2 as the base. That allows it to be upgraded or downgraded with relative ease; however, certain code segments may require adjustment to accommodate engine-specific differences (e.g., deprecated or not-yet-implemented variables and functions).

> [!TIP]
> When targeting Unreal Engine 5 based titles, it's recommended to uncomment `#define UE5` in `definitions.h`. In many cases that action alone would be enough to adapt entirity of solution for newer engine.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Disclaimer:** Solution was developed for general use in Unreal Engine powered titles. The author does not condone cheating, modding, or the manipulation of [online competitive games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_esports_games). The author bears no responsibility for the specific games or contexts in which the solution is used.

# Dependencies
### [Dumper-7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7) & [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

# Baseline & Environment
```
Unreal Engine: 4.27.2
C++: ISO 20 | C: Legacy MSVC
Windows SDK: "10.0.26100.0"
Build Configuration: Release
```

# Getting Started
1. Download and extract the repository, or clone it via Git.
2. Generate a Dumper-7 SDK for the target title.
3. Replace the contents of `..\SDKs\Dumper7` with the contents of newly generated, title-specific "CppSDK".
4. Build `UETools-GUI.dll` and load it into the target title process using an appropriate instrumentation method that complies with the gameâ€™s EULA and applicable laws. For the purpose, [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) and [System Informer](https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io/downloads) can be found applicable tools.
